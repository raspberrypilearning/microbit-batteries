## Powering the micro:bit

To run your micro:bit project, without having to connect it to you computer, you will need the **battery pack** and **batteries** that came with your micro:bit. 

### Connect the batteries

Make sure the program you want to run is on the micro:bit amd has been tested, then disconnect the micro USB cable from the micro:bit.

Place the batteries in the battery pack, make sure to line up the `-` and `+` sides of the batteries with the slots.

There is a line on one side of the battery pack, this will slot into the groove on the battery pack connector.
